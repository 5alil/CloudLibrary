# CloudLibrary
The purpose of this project is to create a library for a company to create and maintain their cloud infrastructure efficiently without needing to have deep knowledge about different cloud providers. This library will introduce apis and abstractions that developers can use to design and implement cloud agnostic infrastructure.
